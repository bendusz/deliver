# Reflect

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "/poteto:reflect". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## 1. Locate the active transcript

Before fanning out, find this conversation's transcript. Claude Code stores transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/`, where `<slug>` is the active workspace path encoded with `/` replaced by `-`. Use only the active workspace's directory. Do not glob across `~/.claude/projects/*/`. That crosses workspace boundaries and reads private chats from unrelated projects.

```bash
ls -t ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/*.jsonl ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/*/subagents/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

That covers the session (`<session>.jsonl`) and subagent (`<session>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`) layouts. For each candidate, read its first user message (the first lines may be `queue-operation` records; skip those). Take the file whose first user message contains the conversation's opening user prompt. If none matches, pass a tight digest of the session instead.

## 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

One message, three `Task` calls, `subagent_type: general-purpose`. Not `Explore`: reviewers need MCP access to look up the tickets, chat threads, and observability traces the transcript references, and `Explore` strips MCP tools.

Set `model` on each reviewer and on the synthesizer from the table. If the Task tool rejects a model alias, use the closest available tier and say so.

| Lens | `model` | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|
| Judgment | `opus` | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `sonnet` | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `opus` | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in the `Task` response body.

## 3. Synthesize

One `Task` call, `subagent_type: general-purpose`, `model: opus`. Not `Explore`: it spot-verifies citations through MCP, and `Explore` strips MCP tools. Pass `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. It returns an Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

## 4. Structural enforcement check

Move any Accepted item that a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check would enforce more reliably to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

## 5. Apply

Present the synthesizer's full Accepted / Rejected / Backlog output and wait for explicit approval before applying any Accepted edit. The user picks the subset and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

File each Backlog item to your team's devex or backlog tracker without waiting. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

Follow each approved row's Routing exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): the parent does it directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): hand to your skill-authoring skill if one is installed (for example superpowers' `writing-skills`) and run its draft / test / iterate loop; otherwise the parent drafts it and tests it the same way.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): hand to your skill-authoring skill and tune the description until the trigger test passes.
- `new skill: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to your skill-authoring skill. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done.

## 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
